This article is a test where I try everything I can do with my blog engine,
Galliblog!

This should be a new paragraph.
While this should not.

# This is a header (the big kind)

I can also use *emphasis* and **bold** fonts. Also ~~strikethrough~~.
They can even be ***~~combined~~***.

## Things I stole from [adam-p on github](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links)

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

# Things to do

We should handle lists, images, tables, maybe even videos, syntax highlighting,
and jscoq.
All of it would be great!
